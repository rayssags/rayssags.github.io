Hello! I am a master's student at [Valongo Observatory/UFRJ](https://ov.ufrj.br/en/graduate-program/) and part of the extragalactic research group [LASEX](https://lasex-valongo.com/). Currently, I am working on using mid-infrared spectroscopy to search for evidences of growing black holes in Lyman Break Analogs.
