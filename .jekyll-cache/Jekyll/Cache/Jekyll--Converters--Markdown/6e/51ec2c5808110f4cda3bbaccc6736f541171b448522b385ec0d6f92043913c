<p>Hello! My name is Rayssa, and I am a master’s student at <a href="https://ov.ufrj.br/en/graduate-program/">Valongo Observatory/UFRJ</a> and part of the extragalactic research group <a href="https://lasex-valongo.com/">LASEX</a>. Here I will tell you a bit about how I ended up where I (academically) am!</p>

<p>Since I was little, I have always loved science. My elementary school teachers frequently told my parents that I would become a scientist. They were right. When I had to decide where to go to high school, I opted for a technical school: the distant CEFET/RJ Uned/NI.  Even though I have always liked astronomy, during high school, I became fascinated by chemistry. That is why I entered the Bioprocess Engineering course at UFRJ’s School of Chemistry in 2014.</p>

<p>Even after a few semesters, my love for astronomy did not fade, and I decided to pursue it as my career. In 2017 I transferred to the Astronomy course, at Valongo Observatory.  It was one of the best decisions I made in my life, and at the moment, I am in the first year of my master’s degree!</p>

<p>During my undergraduate degree in astronomy, I developed research on the use of astrochemistry as a tool to find black holes in nearby galaxies under the tutelage of the incredible <a href="https://lasex-valongo.com/kmd/">Karín Menendez-Delmestre</a>, my current master’s advisor. Our work earned an Honorable mention in UFRJ’s Scientific Initiation Journeys of 2018 and 2019!</p>

<p>In the first semesters in astronomy, I discovered an unexpected love and aptitude for programming. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to intern between 2018 and 2019 at Fundação Getúlio Vargas in the area of data analysis. I am a big Python enthusiast, and whenever I can, I like to learn new things and polish my skills.</p>

<p>Currently, I am researching the use of mid-infrared and astrochemical spectroscopy to investigate evidence of black holes in Lyman Break Analogs. Outside of astronomy, I am passionate about gardening, a beginner cellist and designer, crazy about dogs and science popularization projects. You can find out more about the projects I am part of here.</p>
