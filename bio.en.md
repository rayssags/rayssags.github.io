Hello! My name is Rayssa, and I am a master's student at [Valongo Observatory/UFRJ](https://ov.ufrj.br/en/graduate-program/) and part of the extragalactic research group [LASEX](https://lasex-valongo.com/). Here I will tell you a bit about how I ended up where I (academically) am!

Since I was little, I have always loved science. My elementary school teachers frequently told my parents that I would become a scientist. They were right. When I had to decide where to go to high school, I opted for a technical school: the distant CEFET/RJ Uned/NI.  Even though I have always liked astronomy, during high school, I became fascinated by chemistry. That is why I entered the Bioprocess Engineering course at UFRJ's School of Chemistry in 2014.

Even after a few semesters, my love for astronomy did not fade, and I decided to pursue it as my career. In 2017 I transferred to the Astronomy course, at Valongo Observatory.  It was one of the best decisions I made in my life, and at the moment, I am in the first year of my master's degree!

During my undergraduate degree in astronomy, I developed research on the use of astrochemistry as a tool to find black holes in nearby galaxies under the tutelage of the incredible [Karín Menendez-Delmestre](https://lasex-valongo.com/kmd/), my current master's advisor. Our work earned an Honorable mention in UFRJ's Scientific Initiation Journeys of 2018 and 2019!

In the first semesters in astronomy, I discovered an unexpected love and aptitude for programming. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to intern between 2018 and 2019 at Fundação Getúlio Vargas in the area of data analysis. I am a big Python enthusiast, and whenever I can, I like to learn new things and polish my skills.

Currently, I am researching the use of mid-infrared and astrochemical spectroscopy to investigate evidence of black holes in Lyman Break Analogs. Outside of astronomy, I am passionate about gardening, a beginner cellist and designer, crazy about dogs and science popularization projects.
