Hello! My name is Rayssa, and I am a master's student at Valongo Observatory/UFRJ and part of the Laboratory of Extragalactic Astronomy.

Since I was little, I have always loved science. My elementary school teachers frequently told my parents that I would be a scientist. They were right. When I had to choose where to go to high school, I opted for a technical school: the distant CEFET/RJ Uned/NI. I have always liked astronomy, but during high school I was fascinated by chemistry and how mascroscopic phenomena could be explained by such small things. So I ended up entering the Bioprocess Engineering course at the UFRJ School of Chemistry in 2014.

Even after a few semesters, my love for astronomy did not pass and I decided to pursue it as my career. In 2017 I transferred to the Astronomy course, at the Observatório do Valongo at UFRJ. It was one of the best decisions I made in my life and at the moment I am in my first year of master's degree!

During my undergraduate degree in astronomy, I developed research on the use of astro-chemistry as a tool to find black holes in nearby galaxies under the tutelage of the incredible Karín Menendez-Delmestre, my current master's advisor. Our work earned an Honorable mention in UFRJ's Scientific Initiation Journeys of 2018 and 2019!

In the first semesters in astronomy I discovered an unexpected love and aptitude for programming. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to intern between 2018 and 2019 at Fundação Getúlio Vargas in the area of data analysis. I am a big Python enthusiast and whenever I can, I like to learn new things and polish my skills.

Currently, in my master's degree, I am researching the use of mid-infrared and astro-chemical spectroscopy to investigate evidence of black holes in Lyman Break Analogs. Outside of astronomy, I am passionate about gardening, a begginer cellist and designer, crazy about dogs and science popularization projects. You can find out more about the projects I am part here.
